Custom Spigot plugin for a small custom Minecraft server. Probably not fit for
your server.

Features
--------

- Temporarily ban players on death
- Delete all items in inventory on death
- Drop player head on death
- Ban time increases after multiple deaths
- Respawn ignores beds or anchors
- Grant absorption for a short time after respawn to mitigate getting
  spawnkilled
- (TODO) Spectate on death during Ender Dragon fight (then ban after)
- (TODO) Broadcast any significant items lost to death
